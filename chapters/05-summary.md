# Summary

## A Long Story Short

* PHP has been around for a while and is definitely battle tested.
* The advanced language features of modern PHP were quickly adopted by the developer community.
* PHP successfully made the transition from a hackish script language to a full-featured object-oriented language.
* The language sure lost some of its relevancy to other, more recent technology.

## Should you use PHP?

* Yes, if you're already used to it.
* Maybe, if you're a novice and want to write your first web application.
* No, if you already know some high level language.
